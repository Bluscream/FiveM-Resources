# Dutch Players Inventory
Everybody needs an inventory, right? Have some fun with it and leave a star if you like it!

# Important
 Go to you es_extended/server/main.lua line 423 the event name is esx:onPickup and add after line 430 this code
 ```lua
if pickup.weaponID ~= nil then
	TriggerEvent('DP_Inventory:weaponID', pickup.weaponID, xPlayer.identifier)
end
```
Very important so when somebody pick the weapon from ground is the same it should like like that after

    Then go to es_extended/server/functions.lua line 285 and add this
 ```lua
if name == 'WEAPON_PISTOL' or name == 'WEAPON_FLASHLIGHT' or name == 'WEAPON_STUNGUN' or name == 'WEAPON_KNIFE' or name == 'WEAPON_BAT' or name == 'WEAPON_ADVANCEDRIFLE' or name == 'WEAPON_APPISTOL' or name == 'WEAPON_ASSAULTRIFLE'
or name == 'WEAPON_ASSAULTSHOTGUN' or name == 'WEAPON_ASSAULTSMG' or name == 'WEAPON_AUTOSHOTGUN' or name == 'WEAPON_CARBINERIFLE' or name == 'WEAPON_SNIPERRIFLE' or name == 'WEAPON_COMBATPISTOL' or name == 'WEAPON_PUMPSHOTGUN' or name == 'WEAPON_SMG' then
	local hash = GetHashKey(name)
	MySQL.Async.fetchAll('SELECT * FROM ammunition WHERE hash = @hash AND owner = @owner', {
		['@hash'] = hash,
		['@owner'] =  xPlayer.identifier
	},function(results)
		if #results ~= 0 then
			if results[1].weapon_id then
				ESX.Pickups[pickupId].weaponID = results[1].weapon_id
				MySQL.Async.execute('UPDATE ammunition SET owner = @owner WHERE id = @id and hash = @hash and weapon_id = @weapon_id', {
					['@id'] = results[1].id,
					['@owner'] = nil,
					['@weapon_id'] = results[1].weapon_id,
					['@hash'] = hash
				}, function(results2)
				end)
			else
				ESX.Pickups[pickupId].weaponID = nil
			end
		end
	end)
end
```
    so it looks like that

If you are using another weapon shop we have added a support for that you just simple do this when you are giving the weapon to the player.
You have to change some names this is an exmaple that i am using just change the attachment table and if you have a value in there that is not an attachment just blacklist it like the tint value in the `example:`
```lua
local wepInfo = {}
wepInfo.count = 100
wepInfo.weapon_id = exports['DP_Inventory']:GenerateWeapon()
if cachedData["attachedComponents"] ~= nil then
	wepInfo.attach = {}
	for k,v in pairs(cachedData["attachedComponents"]) do
		if k ~= 'tint' then
			table.insert(wepInfo.attach, k)
		end
	end
end
local skin = GetPedWeaponTintIndex(cachedData["ped"], GetHashKey(weaponModel))
skin = 'skin'..skin
table.insert(wepInfo.attach, skin)
TriggerServerEvent('dp_inventory:updateAmmoCount', GetHashKey(weaponModel), wepInfo)
local addToSlote = true
TriggerEvent('dp_inventory:addCurrentWeapon', weaponModel, wepInfo, addToSlote)
```
Your number 1 inventory for ESX 1.2!

We have edited the original esx_inventoryhud resource from [Trsak](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-esx-inventory-hud-2-4-properties-trunks-players-shops-storages/).

This inventory only works with the latest version of ESX. You can download v1-final here: https://github.com/esx-framework/es_extended/tree/v1-final

Your help is much appreciated in a pull request!

We did not make any of these scripts. We do not take any credits. Did we forget to mention you in the credits? Then let us know in our Discord server or create an issue!
